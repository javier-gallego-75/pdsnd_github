### Project Title
Bikeshare data

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have rapidly grown in both number and popularity across cities worldwide. These systems enable users to rent bikes for short periods, offering the flexibility to pick up a bike at one location and return it to another. Alternatively, users can choose to return the bike to the same station if they simply want to enjoy a round trip. In any case, each bike can serve multiple users throughout the day.
Advancements in information technology have made accessing and returning bikes more convenient than ever. Riders can effortlessly unlock or dock their bikes at designated stations, and these systems generate valuable data that provide insights into user behavior and overall system usage.
In this project, you will analyze data provided by Motivate, a bike-sharing service operating in several major U.S. cities, to uncover key usage trends. Specifically, you will compare usage patterns across three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C.
